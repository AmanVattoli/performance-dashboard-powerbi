# Performance Report Dashboard

This project is a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the financial performance of a company.
The dashboard provides an interactive and comprehensive view of year-to-date (YTD) and prior year-to-date (PYTD) performance metrics, segmented by various dimensions such as country, product type, and profitability. Users can switch between different metrics including Gross Profit, Quantity, and Sales.

## Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter the data by metric categories (Gross Profit, Quantity, Sales) and select the year.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: 
  - **YTD Metric**: Displays the total value of the selected metric (Gross Profit, Quantity, or Sales) year-to-date.
  - **PYTD Metric**: Shows the total value of the selected metric for the same period in the previous year.
  - **YTD vs PYTD Difference**: Highlights the difference in the selected metric between the current year and the previous year.
  - **Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)**: Indicates the gross profit margin as a percentage.
